## FAQs

### Why is Markdown better than word or PDF?

Markdown better because:

- Is easier to learn and use, even when it isnt exported
- Widely used

### Why is my resume not showing up?

If your resume is not showing up I would check the following:

#### Check your settings

- If you just clicked on generate page, it might take some minutes for the Github to build your page.
- Is your folder rooted in root

#### Check your actions

- Have all your checks passed? You can check this by going on actions and checking that all of the `pages build and deployment` have a checkmark

#### Check your repo setup

- Make sure your resume information is in a file called `index.md`.
- Can you see the `index.md` on your git repo? If not, make sure to push all your changes to main.
